TrajSuffixTree
==============


This project aims at developing a new data structure based on suffix trees to handle the problem of finding frequent sub-trajctories, namely the time-annotated sequences. Modifications are applied to original suffix trees so that string-matching could be extended to spatio-temporal data matching.
